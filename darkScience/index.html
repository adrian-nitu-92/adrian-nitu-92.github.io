Hello to my Dark Science Experiment.

Didja know:
In Java, making classes and methods final is optional, even though the vast majority of classes are not designed for extension by subclassing. Declaring them as final communicates that fact, and is a commonly recommended practice in the Java programming literature (see books like "Effective Java, 2nd edition", and "Practical API Design"). Additionally, it allows static analysis tools (such as Checkstyle, PMD, FindBugs, or your Java IDE) to provide useful warnings about the code (about, for example, a final method which declares to throw a specific checked exception, but doesn't actually throw it; such warning could not be given for a non-final method, since an override could throw the exception).
